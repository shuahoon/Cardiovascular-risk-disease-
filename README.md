# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from the Framingham Heart Study. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), we aim to provide accurate risk assessments based on various demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

## System Requirements

- IBM Cloud Account
- Python 3.7 or higher
- IBM Cloud Object Storage
- IBM Watson Studio
- IBM Watson Machine Learning
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or IBM Cloud Functions
- IBM Cognos Analytics


## Data Description

The dataset consists of over 4,000 records and 15 attributes, including:

- Demographic Factors: Age, gender
- Behavioral Factors: Smoking status, physical activity levels
- Medical Factors: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels
- Family History: Information on family history of cardiovascular diseases

## Algorithm Selection

**Chosen Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**

### Justification
GBM is selected for its high performance in classification tasks and its ability to handle complex interactions between features, making it suitable for predicting CHD risk.

### Data Input
- Demographic factors: Age, gender
- Behavioral factors: Smoking status, physical activity levels
- Medical factors: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels
- Family history: Information on family history of cardiovascular diseases

### Training Process
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
- Feature Engineering: Create additional features as needed
- Normalization: Standardize numerical features
- Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess performance
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize parameters like the number of trees, learning rate, and maximum depth

### Prediction Process
- Real-Time Data Integration: Use real-time patient data for risk assessment
- Output: Generate risk scores and classify patients into risk categories

## Model Training

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Train the GBM model using the preprocessed data.
   - Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Deployment

1. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - Deploy the model using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service for scalability.
   - Alternatively, use IBM Cloud Functions for serverless deployment.

2. **API Development:**
   - Develop a REST API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
   - Integrate the model with clinical systems or user interfaces.

3. **Monitoring & Maintenance:**
   - Continuously monitor model performance.
   - Update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.

## Results

The trained GBM model provides high accuracy in predicting CHD risk, allowing for early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

## Conclusion

The project successfully leverages machine learning to predict the 10-year risk of CHD, providing valuable insights for early intervention and prevention strategies.

## Future Scope

- **Model Improvement:** Continuously update and refine the model with new data.
- **Integration with EHR Systems:** Integrate with Electronic Health Records for seamless risk assessments.
- **Expansion:** Explore additional risk factors and datasets.
